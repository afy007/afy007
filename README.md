- Hi, I’m @afy007, I go by Aki.
- Right now I'm a community college student; I am transferring to a 4-year university to pursue a BS in computer science.
- I’m interested learning full stack development, Big Data, and machine learning
- I’m currently learning DS&A in Java and a little bit of HTML
- I love learning how big problems can be tackled using computer science, and hope to aid in creating impactful and useful software that is easy to use.
